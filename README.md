# Voice_activity_detection

Design audio features and detection algorithms for reliable voice activity detection under various noise conditions.

- Audio features: zero-crossing rate, energy value, one-lag auto-correlation, MFCC(Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients).
- Detection algorithm: non-linear gaussian suppoert vector machine with regularization
